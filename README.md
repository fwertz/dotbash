Fwertz's Bash Files
===================

About
-----

I find myself moving around machines quite frequently so I decided it would be nice to have my own bash configuration files accessible wherever I have or could have git.

### Inspiration
Came upon the already-well-worn idea after reading some blogs belonging to developers which were using GitHub and other repository hosting platforms to distribute/share their common configuration files. I started with my own [vim configurations](https://github.com/fwertz/dotvim) and have moved on from there.

### What's in it
A lot of nothing at this point. I'm super behind in shell scripting, but as I pick it up I plan on adding some creations unique to my workflow.

Installation
------------

    ./install.sh
	source ~/.bashrc
